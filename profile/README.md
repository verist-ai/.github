**Verist** is a deterministic workflow kernel for production AI – built for systems where decisions must be reviewed, reproduced, and explained.

It lets you:

- replay past AI decisions exactly from recorded artifacts
- recompute decisions with new models or prompts
- diff outcomes before they are finalized
- preserve human overrides across recomputation

Verist is **not** an agent framework or orchestrator.  
It is a trust kernel for AI workflows where auditability, review, and reproducible execution are non-negotiable.
