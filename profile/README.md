**Verist** is a deterministic workflow kernel for high-trust AI systems. It lets you:

- replay any past AI output exactly
- recompute with new models or prompts
- diff results before shipping changes
- preserve human overrides across recomputation

Verist is **not** an agent framework or orchestrator.  
It is a trust kernel for AI workflows that require auditability and reproducible execution.
